Application Design/Flow
-----------------------
- On open
	+ If project has been loaded, attempt to load it again
		+ Project directory information will save in an AppData folder (most likely)
	+ If project has not been loaded, prompt to select a folder/create a new project
		+ Ask for project folder
		+ Ask if there is a changelog/docs folder present
			+ If not, create either that is not present
		+ Save project directory as the currently loaded one into a save file (AppData)
		+ Ask for how changelog/docs should be formatted
		+ Save settings into project file (AppData)
- Main Window
	+ Shows editor in middle-right portion
	+ Left side has a sidebar showing available files that can be edited
	+ Settings button for project in top/bottom (?) of sidebar
	+ Window menu (File/Edit/View/Help)
- Color Scheme TBD
- Templates for documentation
